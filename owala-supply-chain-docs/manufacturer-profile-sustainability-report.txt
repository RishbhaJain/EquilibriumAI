   - Vacuum furnace cycle: 4 hours per batch of 200 units

4. POWDER COATING
   - Electrostatic powder application
   - Oven curing at 200°C for 15 minutes per rack
   - 2 coating lines, each with 8-meter curing oven
   - Gas consumption: ~3,200 m³ natural gas per month (coating ovens only)

5. QUALITY CONTROL
   - Vacuum retention test (24hr)
